# USCB React-Based CH5 Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

By default the `build` folder is excluded from source control, except on the `gh-pages` branch where it is used to host the app.

### `npm run demo`

This can be run to test production build output locally.\
Open [http://localhost:8080/uscb-ch5-panel/build](http://localhost:8080/uscb-ch5-panel/build) to view it in the browser.

### Deployment

This app is currently hosted via GitHub pages, and is deployed by pushing to the `gh-pages` branch of the project.

**Warning**: the `gh-pages` branch as a different `.gitignore` file from other branches. Care should be taken when merging from `main` to not overwrite it.
